## Contribute

We accept any contributions, big or small. Before submitting a pull request it's recommended that you communicate with the developers first (on [GitHub](https://github.com/friction2d/friction/issues) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/friction/friction/issues)).

It's always preferred to submit pull requests against the `main` branch.

## Branches and versions

Friction uses `X.Y.Z` version numbers and `vX.Y` branches.

* `X` = Major
* `Y` = Minor
* `Z` = Patch

Branch `main` is always the current branch for the next `X` or `Y` release.

A new stable branch is cut from `main` on each `X` or `Y` release and is maintained until a new stable branch is created. Patch (`Z`) releases comes from the parent stable branch (`vX.Y`).

Important fixes added to `main` will be backported to active stable branches when possible (and within reason).
